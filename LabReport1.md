For each of the commands cd, ls, and cat, and using the workspace you created in this lab:
1. Share an example of using the command with no arguments.
2. Share an example of using the command with a path to a directory as an argument.
3. Share an example of using the command with a path to a file as an argument.

Cd:
1. cd with no arguments
```
{
  [user@sahara ~]$ pwd
  /home
  [user@sahara ~]$ cd
  [user@sahara ~]$ pwd
  /home
}
```
- Printing the "cd" with no arguments brings me back to the home directory, so it does nothing when I am not in a directory. 
- The working directory when the command runs is "/home."
- The reason that I got the output of noting is because I cd brings me back to the home directory, and since I am in the home directory it does nothing.
